Apprenticeship and UCAS Application Data Analysis Project

Overview:

This repository contains the final project that analyses apprenticeship and UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) application data. The primary focus of the analysis is to explore the impact of ethnicity as a key variable in determining career pathway choices among different ethnic groups.

Project Contents:
1. Data Cleaning and Manipulation The data cleaning and manipulation processes are performed using Pandas, a powerful data analysis library in Python. This step ensures that the dataset is prepared and structured appropriately for subsequent analysis.
2. Data Visualisations The repository includes scripts and notebooks for creating various graphs and plots that visually represent the patterns and trends in the apprenticeship and UCAS application data. Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilised to generate informative visualisations.
3. Data Analysis The core of the project involves in-depth data analysis using NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical operations in Python. The analysis focuses on understanding the dynamics of apprenticeship and UCAS applications from the academic years 2019-2020, particularly emphasising the role of ethnicity in career pathway choices.
